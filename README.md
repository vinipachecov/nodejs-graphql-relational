# nodejs-graphql-relational
This is my personal code for the course Criando API's com Node.js, GraphQL, JWT, Sequelize e TS | Udemy

This repo has a project of mine which is a Nodejs API wich a graphql endpoint to manipulate queries inside a MYSQL database. The project is in Typescript, uses GULP 
to automate the project build which is in the default 'dist' folder.

# Purpose
A way of knowing graphql with a node.js framework and improve my backend knowledge :)
